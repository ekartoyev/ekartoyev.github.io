<h1> Legacy Basic </h1>

<h2>Shortening operators</h2>

You can shorten the operators and write "ret" instead of "return" or "li" instead of "list". 
You should avoid shortening the operators too short as it may result in ambiguity.
For example, if you write "l", the program will pick up "list" or "let" whichever comes first
in its internal list of commands.

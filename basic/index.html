<h1> Legacy Basic </h1>
<h2>Operators<h2>
  <h3>If</h3>
  The format is<br>
  <code>if condition [then|goto|then goto] linenumber</code><br>
  Example:<br>
  <code>50 if a<5 then 70 </code><br>
  <code>50 if a>5 goto 70 </code><br>
  <code>50 if a=5 then goto 70 </code><br>
    
<h2>Shortening operators</h2>

You can shorten the operators and write "ret" instead of "return" or "li" instead of "list". 
You should avoid shortening the operators too short as it may result in ambiguity.
For example, if you write "l", the program will pick up "list" or "let" whichever comes first
in its internal list of commands.

<h2> Credits </h2>

<li>  The program uses the library called Exp4J to evaluate math expressions. </li>
<li>  The interpreter's structure was inspired by the lecture "How to write BASIC interpreter in two hours" </li>
</ul>
